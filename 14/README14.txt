"""README - EXERCISE 14"""
introduction to modules. Modules allow you to import more tools into
python than what is already there

By now we have learned about the OS and SYS modules;
we imported SYs to use argv, which allows the usre to input variables into
the command line. It is important to note the distinction between this
and 'raw_input()' which asks the user to manually input values 
using the keyboard while the script is still runnning. argv asks for those
values at initiation.
