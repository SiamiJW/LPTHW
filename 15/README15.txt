"""READ ME - EXERCISE 15: READING FILES"

Pretty cool lesson here. We learned more about how to use both argv and
raw_input(). In addition, we used open() and .read() to open and
read files that we give either in the command line (with argv)
or we give after being prompted (using raw_input())

NOTE: you cannot achieve the same functionality by hardcoding the filename
into the script. We do not do that so that the script can be used for 
any file/.
